# ErasMOVE

## Description

**ErasMOVE** is a website that will be designed to provide ease to students, staff, and department personnel during the Erasmus and Exchange applications. The department coordinators can easily keep track of applications and update information related to the students or universities. Students, on the other hand, can handle pre-application and post-application processes through our app and contact university staff for document-related issues. Besides, the partner university department coordinators can manage their universities’ profiles and interact with incoming students.
